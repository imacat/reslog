2020-02-01
	 arclog is hosted on GitHub now.

2008-11-18
	 1. INSTALL and reslog.en.html: Fixed the grammar on
	    installation with the CPAN or CPANPLUS shell, changed
	    "install with the CPAN shell using" and "install with the
	    CPANPLUS shell using" to "install it with the CPAN shell
	    by running" and "install it with the CPANPLUS shell by
	    running".
	 2. INSTALL* and reslog.*.html: Changed "Fedora/Red Hat" to
	    "Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS".

2008-11-17
	 1. INSTALL and reslog.en.html: Fixed the grammar on required
	    and optional module installation, changed "install using"
	    and "install this using" to "install it by running".

2008-11-15
	 1. reslog.*.html: Fixed so that installation from source and
	    with shells are joint into one sentence.

2008-11-12
	 1. INSTALL*, reslog.*.html: Updated information on
	    optional Perl modules, to describe different installation
	    commands for different operating systems.

2008-11-11
	 1. reslog: Fixed the _private::ProgressBar class so
	    that it does not use() Term::ReadKey, but require() it
	    at object initialization.  This enables it to work
	    when Term::ReadKey is missing.
	 2. reslog: Fixed the update() method of the
	    _private::ProgressBar class, to accept a dynamic label.

2008-09-30
	 1. reslog: Update the update() method of the the
	    _private::ProgressBar class too use the bracket
	    characters instead of the pipe character for a better
	    visual outlook.

2008-09-29
	 1. reslog: Use the _private::ProgressBar class in replace of
	    the show_progress() function to display the progress bar.
	    This makes the progress bar easier and more pretty.

2008-04-21
	 1. INSTALL and reslog.en.html: Fixed typo: "instalation" to
	    "installation".

2007-12-05
	 1. reslog: Initialize the static variables within BEGIN {...}
	    blocks for all _private::* classes.
	 2. NEWS: Added.  The NEWS file is quite useful in addition to
	    the Changes change log.
	 3. reslog.*.html: Refer to NEWS instead of Changes for release
	    notes.

2007-12-04	version 3.16
	Fixed a bug with empty files created with Compress::Bzip2.
	 1. Makefile.PL: Fixed to prevent importing symbols when
	    checking optional prerequisites.
	 2. reslog: Fixed the check_type() method of the
	    _private::LogFile class, so that empty files are checked
	    with the file name suffix, too.  This solve the issue
	    that Compress::Bzip2 creates empty files which confuse
	    further processing on file name suffix stripping.

2007-12-03
	 1. Build.PL: Fixed the comment.  This file is "Build.PL",
	    not "Makefile.PL".
	 2. Build.PL: Added "use warnings;".

2007-12-03	version 3.15
	Build system fix.
	 1. Makefile.PL: Fixed the required Perl version from
	    "use 5.006" to "use 5.008;".  reslog requires Perl 5.8.0
	    to work.

2007-12-03	version 3.14
	Documentation and test suite fixes.
	 1. reslog.zh-tw.html, reslog.zh-cn.html: Revised the Chinese
	    text on "3-argument open()" so that it is more readable.
	 2. t/_helper.pm: Increased time zone range from -1200 to
	    +1400 in the mkrandlog_normal() and mkrandlog_noip()
	    subroutines.
	 3. t/_helper.pm: Version number increased to 0.05.
	 4. t/_helper.pm: Fixed time zone text generation in the
	    mkrandlog_normal() and mkrandlog_noip() subroutines,
	    using "%+05d" instead of "%+03d%02d" so that we will
	    get a correct representation in time zones +0030 and
	    -0030.
	 5. t/03-errors.t: Fixed the title of the "a same log file
	    specified more than once" test.
	 6. reslog.*.html: Added <dfn>...</dfn> to the description.

2007-12-03	version 3.13
	 1. t/03-errors.t: Added.
	 2. t/reslog.*.html: Revised.
	 3. t/_helper.pm: Fixed the way deal with time zone in the
	    mkrndlog_normal() and mkrndlog_noip() subroutines, using
	    gmtime($t + $tz) instead of calculating time zone offset
	    with $tz + (timegm(localtime)-timelocal(localtime)).  This
	    is the easy and right way to do.
	 4. reslog.zh-tw.html, TODO.zh-tw, TODO.zh-cn: Changed
	    '繁體中文' to '正體中文'.

2007-12-02
	 1. t/02-several.t: Added, to replace the t/04-hybrix.t.
	 2. t/04-hybrix.t: Removed

2007-12-01
	 1. reslog: Use "use 5.008" instead of "use 5.8.0", for
	    compatibility with older Perl, and get ride of the warning
	    of Perl 5.10.

2007-11-30
	 1. reslog, reslog.*.html: The default keep mode in the
	    documentation is "restart", but it is actually running
	    "delete" in the source code and in the test suite.  The
	    documentation is fixed to "delete" according to the
	    actual program behavior.
	 2. t/_helper.pm: Renamed the mkrndlog() subroutine to
	    mkrndlog_normal().  Renamed the mknoiprndlog()
	    subroutine to mkrndlog_noip().  Added the
	    mkrndlog_empty() subroutine.
	 3. reslog: Added check on whether the suffix to be appended
	    is the same to the suffix to be trimmed.  This cause
	    the same file be overwritten as the resolved result.
	 4. t/01-exhaust.t: Combining t/01-plain.t, t/02-gzip.t,
	    t/03-bzip2.t

2007-11-27
	 1. Makefile.PL, Build.PL: Clean-up old file found message.
	 2. Makefile.PL: Added message for optional prerequisites.
	 3. reslog.zh-tw.html, reslog.zh-cn.html: Tag the languages.

2007-11-26
	 1. t/_helper.pm, t/*.t: Updated the license to GPLv3.
	 2. README.zh-tw, README.zh-cn: File "Changes.zh-tw" and
	    "Changes.zh-cn" no longer exists.  Fixed as "Changes".
	 3. fdl.txt: Added.
	 4. MSWin32 and MS-Win32 is now written as MS-Windows in the
	    documentation.
	 5. reslog: Reorder the debug message in the check_gzip() and
	    check_bzip2() methods of the _private::IO class.
	 6. Makefile.PL, Build.PL: Fixed comment typo. ("any old files")
	 7. Build.PL: Added "recommends" and "build_requires".

2007-11-25
	 1. reslog.en.html, INSTALL: Fixed the typo "archieve" as "archive".
	 2. reslog: Fixed to return ref($GZIP_IO)->new instead of $GZIP_IO
	    in the check_gzip() method, ref($BZIP2_IO)->new instead of
	    $BZIP2_IO in the check_bzip2() method of the _private::IO class,
	    so that a same I/O handler will not be returned to different log
	    files.

2007-11-22
	 1. reslog: Fixed $SIG{__WARN__} to $SIG{"__WARN__"} in the
	    parse_args() subroutine.

2007-11-20
	 1. t/_helper.pm: Added the randip() subroutine to provide random IP
	    that has reliable reverse-lookup DNS.

2007-11-19
	 1. t/_helper.pm: Fixed the flist() subroutine to exclude non-files.
	 2. t/_helper.pm, t/*.t: Add the prsrvsrc() subroutine to preserve the
	    source file for debugging.
	 3. t/_helper.pm, t/*.t: Add the cleanup() subroutine to clean-up the
	    test directory after success or failure.
	 4. t/*.t: Removed the strange escaping of double-quotation character
	    of reslog path.

2007-11-18
	 1. reslog: Move the TYPE_PLAIN, TYPE_GZIP and TYPE_BZIP2 constants
	    from the _private::LogFile package to the main package, so that
	    other packages can use it, too.
	 2. t/_helper.pm: Added the TYPE_PLAIN, TYPE_GZIP and TYPE_BZIP2
	    constants for easier use.
	 3. reslog: Clean up File::Spec::Functions references.
	 4. Makefile.PL and Build.PL: Changed the clean-up list from "t/log/*"
	    to "t/log*".

2007-11-17
	 1. _helper.pm: Moved rel2abs() from a method of the _private::LogFile
	    class to a utility subroutine of the main package.  rel2abs() may
	    be used elsewhere.

2007-11-15
	 1. UPGRADE, UPGRADE.zh-tw, UPGRADE.zh-cn: Removed the outdated file
	    location change for version 3.02 or earlier.  The file location
	    has changed later.  The old change is meaningless.
	 2. UPGRADE, UPGRADE.zh-tw, UPGRADE.zh-cn: Added "perl Build.PL" to
	    the file location change instruction.
	 3. UPGRADE.zh-tw, UPGRADE.zh-cn: Added Chinese translation to the
	    reason of the script name change.
	 4. t/_helper.pm: Update the style of mkrndlog() and mknoiprndlog().
	    Added more status, adjusting more possibility to HTTP/1.1 and
	    status 200.  Fixed the comment that host type 1 is IP and 0 is
	    domain name.
	 5. t/_helper.pm: Added a random URL generator to mkrndlog() and
	    mknoiprndlog().
	 6. t/_helper.pm: Removed rmalldir() and mkcldir(), and replaced with
	    mkpath() and rmtree() from File::Path.

2007-11-14
	 1. reslog: Moved the check_gzip() method and the check_bzip2() method
	    from the _private::LogFile package to the _private::IO package,
	    so that it can be used by other packages, and removed the $self
	    variable.  It is not used anyway.  The 2 methods are called as
	    static methods now.
	 2. reslog: Renamed the new_read() method as open_read(), the
	    new_write() method as open_write(), the new_append() method
	    as open_append().  Replaced the strange architect that start
	    a new instance with $ioclass, with reusing the same $io object.
	 3. reslog: Renamed the new_read() method as open_read(), the
	    new_write() method as open_write(), the new_append() method
	    as open_append().  Replaced the strange architect that start
	    a new instance with $ioclass, with reusing the same $io object.
	 4. reslog: Changed " -- " to " - " in comment.
	 5. reslog: Changed "Deal the ~ home directories under UNIX" to
	    "Deal with the ~ user home directories under UNIX",
	    "If start from user's home directory" to
	    "If it starts from the user home directory".
	 6. reslog: Fixed the rel2abs() method so that it use getpwuid()
	    instead of getlogin(), and respect the HOME environment variable
	    for the current user.
	 7. reslog: Fixed parse_args() to treat "/dev/stdin" as STDIN on
	    UNIX-like systems.
	 8. reslog: Fixed parse_args() and removed the duplicated short help
	    on Getopt::Long::GetOptions errors.
	 9. reslog: Fixed show_progress() to reset the clean-up the start
	    time when progress is finished.

2007-07-23	version 3.12
	Fixed the error when there is no IP to be resolved.
	 1. reslog: Fixed the "division by zero" error when there is no IP
	    to be resolved.
	 2. _helper.pm: Added subroutine mknoiprndlog($) to create random log
	    files without any IP.
	 3. t/01-plain.t, t/02-gzip.t, t/03-bzip2.t: Added test 15 and 16 to
	    test resolving empty log files.

2007-07-23	version 3.11
	Fixed problem with systems without useithreads, fixed bug checking
	STDIN file type with the file program, moved files back to the Perl
	default installation directories, and added support for installation
	with Module::Build.
	 1. Build.PL: Added to support installation with Module::Build.

2007-07-22
	 1. reslog.en.html: Updated "Internet Protocol" as "internet protocol"
	    in abbreviation title.
	 2. reslog: Fixed the new() method of the _private::LogFile::STDIN
	    class, to run unlink0() after checking the file type, to fix the
	    issue that file was removed before checking the file type with
	    the file program
	 3. reslog: Fixed _private::Resolver::Threaded, to load threads
	    in eval() and define share() when threading is not available, in
	    order to work with systems that are not compiled with useithreads.

2007-07-22	version 3.10
	Documentation fixes.
	 1. Removed pod2htmd.tmp, pod2htmi.tmp from distribution.

2007-07-21
	 1. reslog.html: HTML fixes for accessibility, correct HTML character
	    references, HTML numeric references, author information and so on.
	 2. Changes: Version number 3.10 was updated as 3.09.  I was planning
	    to bounce the version to 3.10, but forgot this and tagged 3.09
	    everywhere.  Well, then let it be 3.09 anyway.

2007-07-21	version 3.09
	License updated to GPLv3, and various fixes.
	 1. INSTALL and reslog.html: Replace Term::Size with Term::ReadKey.
	 2. Changes.zh-tw and Changes.zh-cn: Removed.
	 3. License updated to GPLv3.
	 4. COPYING.zh-tw and COPYING.zh-cn: Removed since official
	    translation of GPLv3 is not available yet.
	 5. Removed stupid "All rights reserved" from the copyright notice.
	    It shouldn't appear from the beginning.
	 6. Makefile.PL: Rearranged the order, and added LICENSE and SIGN.

2006-06-12
	 1. reslog: new() method of _private::LogFile class now opens
	    the log file and bounces there, instead of checking the log file
	    first.  This way we will return localed system error message.
	 2. reslog: new() method of _private::LogFile class now opens
	    the log file in read-only mode when keep all.
	 2. reslog: check_type() method of _private::LogFile class now returns
	    the type instead of setting $self->{"type"}, for code readability.

2006-06-11
	 1. reslog: new() method of _private::LogFile class now initialized
	    STDIN with _private::LogFile::STDIN class, instead of bouncing.
	    parse_args() subroutine does not initialize the files twice now.
	 2. reslog: Upper-case the error messages in _private::LogFile.
	 3. reslog: check_io() method of _private::LogFile class now returns
	    the IO object instead of setting $self->{"io"}, for code
	    readability.
	 4. reslog: Fixed _private::LogFile::STDIN::new() method that we
	    passed an extra empty argument to tempfile().
	 5. reslog: Fixed comment, use "handler" instead of "handle".

2006-06-08
	 1. reslog: Revised the code with my own coding standard.
	 2. reslog: Added "bundling" to Getopt::Long::Configure().  This
	    might introduce option-processing incompatibility.
	 3. reslog: Replaced Term::Size and Win32::Console with Term::ReadKey.
	    Term::ReadKey seems to be more recent and portable.

2006-05-28
	 1. INSTALL and reslog.html: Fixed the bzip2 website address.

2005-05-22	version 3.08
	Documentation fixes.
	 1. The last update of the HTML documents are fixed.
	 2. Changes: English change log was gone.  (Maybe lost when
	    cut-and-paste?)  A correct one is supplied.

2005-05-22	version 3.07
	 1. reslog: No more checks on the availability of STDIN and STDOUT,
	    and no more dummy replacement created if not.  It was originally
	    to solve perl.cpan.testers 202971 when running with CPANPLUS under
	    MSWin32, duplicating closed STDIN causes errors.  But I was going
	    the wrong way.  I was testing STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR redirection in
	    shell backticks.  Whether CPANPLUS closes STDIN or not should be
	    irrelevant.  It may be a issue of the shell backticks itself.
	    Anyhow I rewrote the testing executing method and it is solve.  In
	    fact, it's still not working when STDIN and STDOUT is unavailable.
	    But IPC::Open3 won't work on that, too.  It should be safe to be
	    ignored.
	 2. t/_helper.pm: runcmd() was rewritten.  It now run the command with
	    pipe open instead of shell backticks.  It's API is hence changed.
	 3. t/_helper.pm: frread() and frwrite() are added to do raw file
	    read-write.
	 4. t/01-plain.t, t/02-gzip.t, t/03-bzip2.t, t/04-hybrix.t: Edited
	    for the new runcmd() API.
	 5. t/_helper.pm: Unused subroutines cp() and rm() are removed.
	 6. t/01-plain.t, t/02-gzip.t, t/03-bzip2.t, t/04-hybrix.t: Added
	    "use diagnostics;" to help debugging.
	 7. Successfully tested and run under Linux 2.4 i686, Linux 2.6 i686,
	    Linux 2.4 AMD64, FreeBSD, Solaris, MacOSX Darwin, MSWin32 and
	    cygwin.  (Thanks to SourceForge compile farm for providing testing
	    platforms.)
	 8. THANKS, THANKS.zh-tw, THANKS.zh-cn: Edited.

2005-05-19
	 1. reslog: Use stat() to check whether STDIN and STDOUT are
	    available, instead of duplicate them and check if success
	    directly.  This avoids the problem on MacOSX Darwin where trying
	    to duplicate unopened STDIN crashes directly instead of dies that
	    can be caught by eval().
	 2. t/01-plain.t, t/02-gzip.t, t/03-bzip2.t, t/04-hybrix.t: Add
	    option -d -d -d for more debug information when failures occur.
	 2. t/_helper.pm: Prepend the command line to the STDERR result to
	    ease debugging.

2005-05-18
	Solaris fix.
	 1. The file executable on Solaris does not accept file content from
	    STDIN.  This is solved.  The target file name is passed to the
	    file executable.  When reading from STDIN in this case, a named
	    temporary file is created for this and deleted whenever possible.
	 2. t/01-plain.t, t/02-gzip.t, t/03-bzip2.t, t/04-hybrix.t: Use updir
	    for composing the script name in the old way, but not popping
	    splitdir().  $FindBin::Bin may return a directory ended with a
	    slash which become an empty part in splitdir. (Fedora 3 on AMD64)
	 3. Tested on Sparc/Solaris, FreeBSD, Fedora 3 on AMD64.
	 4. t/01-plain.t, t/02-gzip.t, t/03-bzip2.t, t/04-hybrix.t: Setting
	    wrong testing parameter.  -t 1 should be -n 1.
	 5. reslog: Checks on whether flock() success or not are removed.  In
	    some specific situation flock() is simply not available.  For
	    example, MacOSX Darwin has flock() on local file systems, but not
	    over NFS.  It's not possible to detect and avoid all these
	    situation.

2005-05-17
	 1. pgpkey.asc: Updated with the new identity with UTF-8 names.

2005-05-16	version 3.06
	 1. t/99-pod.t added to test the POD document with Test::Pod.
	 2. t/01-plain.t, t/02-gzip.t, t/03-bzip2.t: Added test for failures
	    on existing temporary files.
	 3. t/_helper.pm: Added prevention of generating IP 127.0.0.1.
	 4. reslog: Added package _private::Filter and move
	    _private::Resolver::parse_line() and
	    _private::Resolver::replace_line() there, to allow easier
	    implementing different log file formats.  Like GeoIP, or maybe
	    MS-Extended, in the future.
	 5. reslog: Fixed the POD document.  Section of links L<...> should
	    be section headings in the document, but not manpage sections.
	    This is fixed.  Web site URLs are added to the AUTHOR section.
	    Mailing list URL is added to the BUGS section.

2005-05-15
	Test suite fix.
	 1. t/02-gzip.t, t/03-bzip2.t: Tests that weren't skipped when gzip or
	    bzip2 is not available is fixed.  (perl.cpan.testers 205969)
	 2. t/01-plain.t, t/02-gzip2.t, t/03-bzip2.t, t/04-hybrix.t: $nofile
	    replaced $hasfile.  $nogzip replaced $hasgzip.  $nobzip2 replaced
	    $hasbzip2.  Skipping reason supplied.
	 3. reslog: devnull is used instead of tempfile when STDIN or STDOUT
	    is not available.
	 4. reslog: Not only STDIN, but all files are checked if they are
	    specified more than once.
	 5. t/MyHelper.pm: Subroutines thisfile(), rmalldir(), mkcldir(),
	    fwrite(), whereis(), ftype(), flist(), mkrndlog(), randword() are
	    added.  Subroutine readfile() is renamed as fread().  Prototype
	    cplist() is corrected as cp().  Subroutine rm() is removed.
	 6. t/01-plain.t, t/02-gzip2.t, t/03-bzip2.t, t/04-hybrix.t: I joined
	    subtests together and shrank the total number of tests.  They
	    should be one tests anyway.  This way I can test more on the result.
	 7. t/MyHelper.pm: flist() is added so that I can test if the resulted
	    files list is correct.  Several subtests on whether a file exists
	    are removed.
	 8. t/MyHelper.pm: ftype() is added so that I can test if the resulted
	    file format is correct.
	 9. t/MyHelper.pm: mkrndlog() is added to generate random Apache
	    access_log files.  No more sample log files shipped anymore.  The
	    test result should be better, too, since the content of the test
	    log files vary now.  The content of the shipped samples are all
	    the same in fact.
	10. t/MyHelper.pm: Renamed to _helper.pm, to avoid CPAN namespace
	    pollution.

2005-05-08
	Bug fix.
	 1. STDIN and STDERR are checked for availability first, and create
	    dummy ones if they are not available.  This fixed the bugs that on
	    MSWin32 when STDIN is not opened, redirecting unopened STDIN
	    caused error.  This is the situation running "make test" in
	    CPANPLUS.  (perl.cpan.testers 202971)

2005-05-08	version 3.04
	 1. Fixed a typo when loading File::MMagic that prevent itself from
	    loading File::MMagic

2005-05-08	version 3.03
	 1. flock() policy is redesigned.  Now all the file handles that are
	    not opened to ordinary files are not locked.  Lock is released when
	    when file handle is accessed with a foreign program.  Files handles
	    are always locked when opened to ordinary files and accessed
	    internally, even for anonymous temporary files.  This simplified
	    the locking problem.  How foreign programs access file handles are
	    not an issue anymore.
	 2. Makefile.PL: MY package is added.  Makefile target "upgrade" is
	    added to remove the old files.  constants() and manifypods()
	    methods are added to alter the default install location.  Now we
	    default to install to /sbin directory and as manpage section 8.
	    That is what I want.
	 3. BUGS and TODO section of the embedded POD document updated.

2005-05-02	version 3.02
	 1. _private::Resolver and _private::Resolver::Threaded are added.
	    Resolver is independent from the main program so that other log
	    file filter can use the same code with least modification (GeoIP,
	    for example).
	 2. Help text on temporary working file updated.
	 3. Unsupported file format error message was using $type, which
	    should be $_.  This is fixed.
	 4. Test 31-39 added to test --suffix and --trim-suffix.
	 5. Tested with cygwin.
	 6. Quotes added to the test suite to avoid problem when make test
	    in directories whose names may contain spaces.
	 7. Required Perl version changed to 5.8.0.  5.7.2 is a development
	    version.  It's meaningless to require that.

2005-05-01	version 3.0102
	 1. check_magic(), check_gzip() and check_bzip2() now check the return
	    value of eval() directly, instead of saving it in $ok and check
	    that.
	 2. %CONF is introduced to save the configuration.
	 3. $THIS_FILE, $SHORTHELP and $VERBOSE are moved from
	    "use vars qw(...)" to "our (...)", to ease program management.
	 4. DEFAULT_PROGBAR is introduced to handle the default display status
	    of the progress bar.

2005-05-01	version 3.0101
	Labours' Day!
	 1. Package name changed from ResLog to main, to avoid polluting the 
	    CPAN namespace.
	 2. Class names changed from ResLog::* to _private::*, to avoid
	    polluting the CPAN namespace.
	 3. check_io() returns an I/O interface object instead of an I/O type
	    constant, so that the I/O handler object can be generated from it
	    directly.  new_read(), new_write() and new_append() now returns an
	    I/O handler object generated from the I/O interface object.
	 4. use_flock() is added to IO::* I/O handlers to see if flock() is
	    to be used on I/O handlers, to replace run-time checks.  Currently
	    bzip2 on MSWin32 should not use flocks().
	 5. The constants IO_* are removed.
	 6. whereis() now uses ExtUtils::MakeMaker MM->maybe_command() to find
	    the executable.  This is inspired from CPAN::FirstTime.

2005-04-26
	 1. Changes: File edited to widen line limit from 60 columns to 79
	    columns, to ease reading.

2005-04-26	version 3.01
	Bug fix.
	 1. --suffix and --trim-suffix was not working.  I mistakenly put
	    $_[0] instead of $_[1] in the GetOptions() and this wasn't tested!
	    ^^;  This is fixed.
	 2. Correct a typo in the documentation ("rewrite" should be
	    "rewrote").
	 3. Fixed a mistake that Changes.zh-tw was not updated with
	    Changes.zh-cn.

2005-04-26	version 3.00
	 1. README updated
	 2. HTML documentation updated.
	 3. Uploaded to CPAN.
	 4. HTML documents updated to conform to W3C Web Content Accessibility
	    Guide 1.0 Triple-A now.

2005-04-26	version 2.9901
	 1. INSTALL rewritten.
	 2. UPGRADE added.

2005-04-25
	 1. Module::Signature SIGNATURE gpg signature file added.  The
	    external gpg signature file is no longer used.
	 2. Test suite added.
	 3. Many bugs fixed, thanks to the test suite.

2005-04-24	version 2.99
	This is a new object-oriented version.  I rewrote the whole script
	from an empty file.
	 1. Rewrite everything in object-oriented style.
	 2. ithread threading support is added.  With threading it can check
	    several IP at the same time, dramatically reducing the time cost.
	    This requires Perl 5.7.2 ithread support.  New option
	    --num-threads is added for this.  You can see the effect by
	    running with -d -d.
	 3. Supports for running gzip executable, running Compress::Bzip2,
	    running bzip2 executable are added.  This is the benefit of
	    object-oriented programming.  Log entry read/write is now done
	    through an uniformed I/O handler API.  This eased the addition of
	    new I/O handlers.
	 4. New option --trim-suffix is added to remove certain file name
	    suffix before appending our suffix, so that reslog can line-up
	    with other log file post-processors.
	 5. file utility can be used instead of File::MMagic if that is not
	    available.
	 6. Term::Size is used to display the progress bar under UNIX.  Under
	    MSWin32 Win32::Console will be used instead.  reslog can run
	    without them, but you won't see the progress bar.
	 7. Instead of resolving line by line, reslog now collects all the IP
	    found on all the source log files first, resolve those IP
	    altogether, and replace the IP with the resolved domain name in
	    the log entries at one time.
	 8. The script and project name changed from "reslog.pl" to "reslog".
	    A dot "." in the project name is not valid everywhere, like
	    SourceForge.  "reslog" is enough for a script name under UNIX.
	    MSWin32 users won't run it with explorer file association anyway,
	    and there is a pl2bat to turn reslog to reslog.bat.
	 9. Installation method is changed from my own Install.PL to Perl's
	    standard ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  Utilizing standard is a good thing.
	    Perl's ExtUtils::MakeMaker is more portable than GNU's autoconf.
	    As a result, reslog is installed into /usr/bin instead of
	    /usr/sbin under UNIX.  Of course, reslog don't need installation
	    at all. :p
	10. Version number is changed from 3 digits (2.1.0) to 2 digits
	    (3.00), according to the Perl module convention.
	11. ChangeLog is renamed as Changes, as what ExtUtils::MakeMaker
	    expects.

2003-01-04
	 1. File handler EOF read checks were fixed with defined().

2002-11-13
         1. Long statistic lines are split for easy reading.
         2. open_src() was rewritten according to open_src() in arclog.pl, in
            order to use compression with gzip and bzip2 binary executables.

2002-11-12
	 1. RELEASE_NOTES was renamed as ChangeLog.
	 2. AUTHORS was added.
	 3. THANKS was added.
	 4. The option checking logic was rewritten.
	 5. Fixed several places where $WORKING_SRC was not locked when
	    created with tempfile.
	 6. Fixed several places where spaces are between function name and
	    its opening parenthesis, according to perlstyle(1).
	 7. Unnecessary parenthesis after slice and catfile were removed.

2002-10-28
	 1. Fixed a bug that $WORKING_RES was not locked when opened.  But it
	    is unlocked when closed.  On some systems (like Linux) you can
	    request unlock on a file handle that is not previous locked, but on
	    some others (like MSWin32) requesting unlock on a file handle that
	    is not previous locked will cause error.  $WORKING_RES doesn't
	    really need locking at all.  It is an anonymous temporary file
	    handle, that can be accessed by this same working process only.
	    It has no risk of simultaneously writing without threading, and
	    I'm not doing threading here.  I just lock it for a consistent
	    programming style.  (Thanks to Chen-hsiu Huang
	    <chenhsiu@gens.dhs.org> for reporting this.)

2002-09-28
	 1. File::MMagic and file are now used to check the file type, in
	    addition to the file name suffix, with a more preferred order.
	 2. check_file_type() was added to check the file types by either
	    File::MMagic or file.
	 3. check_gzip() was added to check the gzip method to use.
	 4. check_bzip2() was added to check the bzip2 method to use.

2002-09-18	version 2.1.0dev2
	SourceForge Memorial Release.  It's my first time to apply a project
	from SourceForge.  Mostly are corrections to the documentation.
	SourceForge's project page is added to the available download source
	here.
	 1. reslog.pl's official home page at Tavern IMACAT's was restored.
	 2. The previous version was renamed from 2.1.0-dev1 to 2.1.0dev1, in
	    order to unify the version number theme.
	 3. The project space at SourceForge was applied.  Package files are
	    uploaded to SourceForge now.
	 4. Project virtual host at SourceForge was set up.
	 5. SourceForge was added into the documentation as an official
	    website and download source.
	 6. Documentation were corrected.  Too many places were corrected.
	    Ignored.
	 7. HTML document was rewritten to accommodate
	    XHTML 1.1 recommendation.

2002-08-31	version 2.1.0dev1
	Rewrite after almost 1 year, to be run on the newly-released Perl
	5.8.0.
	 1. File handles are now saved and passed in global named variables.
	    This is the way it should be.  The old way (initialize the file
	    handles by duplicate the STDIN and assign them) was just not
	    natural.  It works in Perl 5.6.1, but not in Perl 5.8.0.  The
	    duplicated file handles are constants, which cannot be assigned new
	    values.
	 2. Indents are changed from 1 tab to 4 columns, to accommodate the
	    Perl style guide documented in perlstyle(1).  This increases the
	    code readability.
	 3. File operation error handlers are now using the
	    low-precedence logical "or", instead of "||",
	    which is recommended in perlop(1).  Excessive
	    parentheses in file operation functions are
	    removed for this.
	 4. Traditional Chinese files are now named with suffix ".zh-tw"
	    instead of ".b5".  Simplified Chinese files are now named with
	    suffix ".zh-cn" instead of ".gb".  This is to accommodate
	    RFC-3066, ISO 639:1988, ISO 3166-1 for language names.
	 5. PGP signatures of distribution files are added.
	 6. bzip2 distribution files are added.

2001-09-03	version 2.0.2
	 1. The bug that taking file handles as private variables and modified
	    them, was fixed.

2001-09-01	version 2.0.1
	 1. The bug that resolved cache %NAMES was not global, was fixed.  The
	    resolved result can be pass between multiple files now.
	 2. A bug that a hyper reference in the English document was not
	    specified as an absolute URL, was fixed.

2001-06-29	version 2.0.0
	First public release.
	 1. Chinese and English standard header were added.
	 2. Getopt::Long was introduced to parse the arguments, in replace of
	    my own argument-parsing routine.
	 3. File::Spec::Functions was introduced to handle the pathname.
	 4. Cwd was introduced to obtain the current working directory.
	 5. autoflush from IO::Handle was introduced, to autoflush STDOUT
	    solely under debugging mode.
	 6. File::Temp was introduced to handle the temporary working file.
	    Processing is done on temporary working files to reduce the time
	    occupying the source and result files.
	 7. Compress::Zlib was used to read the compressed files.
	 8. rel2abs() was added to convert relative paths to absolute paths.
	 9. progress_bar() was added to display current status graphically.
	10. res_log() was added to loop multiple files.
	11. open_src() and save_res() to open source and save result.
	12. POD documents was added.
	13. Release notes was added.
	14. Readme file was added.
	15. GNU General Public License was added.
	16. Installation guide was added.
	17. Install.PL was added in the distribution.

2001-01-21	version 1.3.1
	 1. autoflush was modified to do only under debugging mode.
	 2. Simple header was changed standard header.

2001-01-07	version 1.3.0
	 1. [current/total] was added in the detailed processing messages.

2000-??-??	version 1.2.0
	 1. Custom parse_args() was added to parse the command line arguments.

2000-??-??	version 1.1.0
	 1. "--usetmp" was added to process temporary working files.
	 2. "--suffix" was added to alter the output suffix.
	 3. "--debug" was added to show detailed processing messages.

2000-12-22	version 1.0.0
	First version.

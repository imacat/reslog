* System Requirements

   1. Perl, version 5.8.0 or above.  reslog uses 3-argument open() to
duplicate filehandles, which is only supported since 5.8.0.  I have
not successfully port this onto earlier versions yet.  Please tell me
if you made it.  You can run perl -v to see your current Perl version.
If you do not have Perl, or if you have an older version of Perl, you
can download and install/upgrade it from Perl website.

http://www.perl.com/

      If you are using MS-Windows, you can download and install
ActiveState ActivePerl.

   2. Required Perl modules: None.

   3. Optional Perl Modules

    * File::MMagic

          This is used to check the file type.  If this is not
      available, reslog will look for the file executable instead.
      If that is not available, too, reslog will judge the file type
      by its name suffix (extension).  In that case reslog will fail
      when reading from STDIN.
      You can download and install File::MMagic from the CPAN archive
      http://search.cpan.org/dist/File-MMagic/ ,
      or install it with the CPAN shell by running "cpan File::MMagic",
      or install it with the CPANPLUS shell by running
      "cpanp i File::MMagic".
      Debian/Ubandu Linux users can install it by running
      "apt-get install libfile-mmagic-perl".
      Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS Linux users can install it by running
      "yum install perl-File-MMagic".
      FreeBSD users can install it by running
      "ports install p5-File-MMagic".
      ActivePerl users can install it by running
      "ppm install File::MMagic".
      The alternative file.exe for MS-Windows can be obtained from
      the GnuWin32 home page: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/.
      Be sure to save it as file.exe somewhere in your PATH.
      
          It is preferred to use File::MMagic.  The file executable
      seems to make mistakes occationally.

    * Compress::Zlib

          This is used to support read/write of gzip compressed files.
      It is only needed when gzip compressed files are encountered.
      If it is not available when needed, reslog will try to use the
      gzip executable instead.  If that is not available, too, reslog
      will fail.
      You can download and install Compress::Zlib from the CPAN archive
      http://search.cpan.org/dist/Compress-Zlib/ ,
      or install it with the CPAN shell by running "cpan Compress::Zlib",
      or install it with the CPANPLUS shell by running
      "cpanp i Compress::Zlib".
      Debian/Ubandu Linux users can install it by running
      "apt-get install libcompress-zlib-perl".
      Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS Linux users can install it by running
      "yum install perl-Compress-Zlib".
      FreeBSD users can install it by running
      "ports install p5-Compress-Zlib".
      ActivePerl users can install it by running
      "ppm install Compress::Zlib".
      The alternative gzip.exe for MS-Windows can be obtained from
      the gzip home page: http://www.gzip.org/.
      Be sure to save it as gzip.exe somewhere in your PATH.

    * Compress::Bzip2, version 2 or above

          This is used to support read/write of bzip2 compressed
      files.  It is only needed when bzip2 compressed files are
      encountered.  If it is not available when needed, reslog will
      try to use the bzip2 executable instead.  If that is not
      available, too, reslog will fail.  Notice that older versions
      before 2 does not work, since file I/O compression were not
      implemented yet.
      You can download and install Compress::Bzip2 from the CPAN archive
      http://search.cpan.org/dist/Compress-Bzip2/ ,
      or install it with the CPAN shell by running "cpan Compress::Bzip2",
      or install it with the CPANPLUS shell by running
      "cpanp i Compress::Bzip2".
      Debian/Ubandu Linux users can install it by running
      "apt-get install libcompress-bzip2-perl".
      Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS Linux users can install it by running
      "yum install perl-Compress-Bzip2".
      FreeBSD users can install it by running
      "ports install p5-Compress-Bzip2".
      ActivePerl users can install it by running
      "ppm install Compress::Bzip2".
      The alternative bzip2.exe for MS-Windows can be obtained from
      the bzip2 home page: http://www.bzip.org/.
      Be sure to save it as bzip2.exe somewhere in your PATH.

    * Term::ReadKey

          This is used to display the progress bar.  Without this
      reslog will not display the progress bar, but nothing else is
      different.  The progress bar is a good visual representation of
      what reslog is currently doing.
      You can download and install Term::ReadKey from the CPAN archive
      http://search.cpan.org/dist/TermReadKey/ ,
      or install it with the CPAN shell by running "cpan Term::ReadKey",
      or install it with the CPANPLUS shell by running
      "cpanp i Term::ReadKey".
      Debian/Ubandu Linux users can install it by running
      "apt-get install libterm-readkey-perl".
      Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS Linux users can install it by running
      "yum install perl-TermReadKey".
      FreeBSD users can install it by running
      "ports install p5-Term-ReadKey".
      ActivePerl users can install it by running
      "ppm install Term::ReadKey".


* Installation Instruction

    If you are upgrading from reslog 3.10 or earlier, or if you are
upgrading from reslog.pl 3.02 or earlier, please read UPGRADE for some
upgrade instruction.

** Install with ExtUtils::MakeMaker

    reslog uses standard Perl installation with ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
Follow these steps:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make
    % make test
    % make install

    When running make install, make sure you have the priviledge to
write to the installation location.  This usually requires the root
priviledge.

    If you are using ActivePerl under MS-Windows, you should use
nmake instead of make. nmake can be obtained from the Microsoft FTP
site.

ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe

    If you want to install into another location, you can set the
PREFIX.  For example, to install into your home when you are not
root:

    % perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/jessica

    Refer to the docuemntation of ExtUtils::MakeMaker for more
installation options (by running perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker).


** Install with Module::Build

    You can install with Module::Build instead, if you prefer.
Follow these steps:

    % perl Build.PL
    % ./Build
    % ./Build test
    % ./Build install

    When running ./Build install, make sure you have the priviledge to
write to the installation location.  This usually requires the root
priviledge.

    If you want to install into another location, you can set the
--prefix.  For example, to install into your home when you are not
root:

    % perl Build.PL --prefix=/home/jessica

    Refer to the docuemntation of Module::Build for more
installation options (by running perldoc Module::Build).
